        "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
        "In this paper, we present a comprehensive time series forecasting repository which includes publicly available time series datasets from multiple domains, each with a unique frequency, series length, and inclusion of missing values. We also analyze the datasets and figure out similarities and differences between them using feature analysis. In addition, we illustrate the usefulness of a set of baseline forecasting standards across all datasets and eight error metrics.\n",
        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
        "* The research only compares 13 baselines, which means that it misses certain newly published works. It would be more informative to compare with more advanced time-series forecasting models.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Time-series lack a unified metrics for evaluation. This paper raises this problem but leaves the decision to the owners of specific applications.\n",
        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
        "* There are currently no comprehensive time series forecasting benchmarking archives, to the best of our knowledge, that focus on such datasets of related time series to evaluate the performance of such global forecasting algorithms.\n",
        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### SOLUTION:\n",
        "Our aim is to address this limitation by introducing such an archive. In particular,\n",
        "our paper has the following main contributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The dataset is constructed in a sound way. The experiments are performed reasonably.\n",
        "* We can see major difference in Median MASE, Mean RMSE and Median RMSE but that might be due to low data size. Apart from this we also added one extra model known as a Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL). To add this model we made changes in experiments/fixed_horizon.R, models/local_univariate_models.R, experiments/rolling_origin.R these files.\n",
        "* In this the full pipeline is executed for all local and global models using two single function calls."
